# ant-jag-contrib

This is an extension of [ant-contrib] with contributed tasks.

It was developed in 2013 to help with the building of Eclipse RCP plugins without
using the `build.xml` generated by Eclipse itself, being more generic than those.
One of the disadvantages of using the [Ant] scripts created by Eclipse is that they
change everytime a new dependency is added to the plugin, and then they need to
be checked in in the code repository. However with `ant-jag-contrib`, the
task for building takes automatically the dependency, without further modifications.

## Dependency
It requires the [ant-contrib-1.0b2] library installed in [Ant] classpath
(`ANT_HOME/lib`, `${user.home}/.ant/lib`, etc.).

## Compilation and installation
In order to create the package, you need to have installed [maven]
The generated package `ant-jag-contrib` must be put also into the [Ant]
classpath to be accessible by the script making use of any of the contributed
tasks.

## Tasks
Currently are implemented the following categories:

* [log](src/main/resources/org/jag/common/log/README.md)
* [property](src/main/resources/org/jag/common/property/README.md)
* [build](src/main/resources/org/jag/common/build/README.md)
* [plugin](src/main/resources/org/jag/common/plugin/README.md)
